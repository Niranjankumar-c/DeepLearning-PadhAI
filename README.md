<p align="center"><img width="40%" src="1_assests/logo.png" /></p>

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This repository contains the code files taught from the deep learning course from [PadhAI](https://padhai.onefourthlabs.in/).

## Repository Structure
Each folder inside the repo contains the code for the respective topic and has support to execute the code directly in Google colab and/or Kaggle Kernels without worrying about installing the dependencies
